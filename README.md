# BoxBoy - UT AP Spring 95

This is an implementation of a minimal subset of [BoxBoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoxBoy!), a puzzle platformer video game. Implementing this subset of the game was the 3rd Assignment of my the AP course that I took in [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), during my 2nd semester. 

Since I love creating games, I put a good amount of work into this assignment, and I think the final result is cute, and worth checking out :).

I will soon be adding a video of the game, so that you can quickly get a feel of what the game looks like.

## Getting Started

To play the game, either clone the repository or simply download its ZIP and then extract it. Then, enter the extracted directory, and run the following:
```
./boxboy.out < <map-address>
```
and replace `<map-address>` with the map you want to run. you can find a couple of maps in the `maps` folder.

## Controls

Here is a list of things you can do, and associated controls:
- move the character: arrow keys
- jump: `space`
- create boxes: hold down `x`, and then use the arrow keys
- throw the created boxes: `c` (to throw them to right) or `z` (to throw them to left)
- teleport to the location of the last created box: press `space` while the boxes are still attached to you, but you are in a position where you can't jump. (for example, you're stuck mid-air).
